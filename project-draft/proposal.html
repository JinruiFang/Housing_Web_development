        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>Purchasing a home is a significant life decision. People will spend most of their time at home, perhaps
            starting a family and making lovely memories. For many people, investing in real estate is the most huge
            financial decision they will ever make. As a result, before purchasing a home, people should conduct some
            research on their desired properties, so the acquisition of information is particularly important for
            prospective buyers. However, there is often too much information behind a real estate property, and it can
            be time consuming for buyers to fully integrate every information, and they may also forget to investigate
            certain key aspects. </p>
        <p>The problem could be troubling for some new home buyers. There are some real estate apps on the market such
            as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillow">Zillow</a> that solve this problem by integrating property
            information, construction information, HOA information, and financial information and show them via their
            apps. They make it easier and faster for users to obtain information about properties. However Zillow also
            has some defects. For example, potential buyers may be interested in a property's previous sales record,
            which <a
                href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/10063-Densmore-Ave-N-A-Seattle-WA-98133/2065744070_zpid/?utm_campaign=iosappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare">Zillow
                does not provide</a>. In fact, it is not difficult to obtain sales records because they are public
            records. Therefore, we can make a real estate information sharing website, including but not limited to
            sales records.</p>

        <p>We are fully aware of the importance of openness and symmetry of information for the acquisition of property
            by our clients. In addition to the problems mentioned earlier: the lack of prior sales record may make
            zillow unable to meet the needs of some people's inquiries about specific listings; there are many other
            issues that we should address. For example, whether the information on the app is consistent with the
            information on the real estate company's website; whether the app can be updated to reflect any changes in
            information, etc. </p>
        <p>From a more macro perspective, providing complete information and convenience to customers is not only
            beneficial for both buyers and sellers, but also for optimizing the spatial layout of the city, especially
            for implementing public policies such as affordable housing. Firstly, the openness of information shortens
            the time customers spend hesitating in choosing properties and thus reduces housing market frictions. For
            one thing, the reduced friction decreases the number of vacant housing, and increases property utilization
            rates. For another, it gives government agencies more response time on land use planning when facing
            changing patterns.
        </p>
        <p>So our core purpose is to provide users with a platform that is as detailed as possible, and to provide
            customers with as many listing options as possible while ensuring that the information is accurate, so that
            they can make accurate decisions to meet their needs. At the same time, it allows public policies to benefit
            a wider audience and contribute to social equity.

        <h2>Proposed Application Description</h2>
        <p>The potential users of this webpage would be first of all some real estate traders. Buyers can use this
            website to compare the information of houses with each other and then help them to make a better judgment
            and buy a more satisfactory house. People who are selling their homes can also use this site to get
            information about the prices of other homes and other information to gauge what they want to sell. For
            people who are new to Seattle and are thinking of buying a home, this website can help them to quickly learn
            about Seattle real estate first to help them choose a home.</p>
        <p>These users, who can see some exterior and also interior photos of a house on this website, can get a
            preliminary idea of the basic information of the house. They can also access specific information about the
            house, such as geographic information and price. We will also put on the website how to buy the house, so
            that they can contact the seller when they want to buy. This can be more efficient and convenient. Also, we
            will put some area information such as security, education, health care, etc. to help users to choose the
            area to buy a house.</p>
        <p>Our users will first see the main page that introduces the Top 5 most viewed Buildings around them. They
            can find a specific building that they like by using the search bar. There will also be a filter that allows
            the users to change their budget, location, building types, etc. Every building has its own page that shows
            detailed
            information including the floor plan, the contact information of the owner, and also price range.</p>
        <p>This app will help our target users to find useful information about the buildings around them.
            Our app can generate a list of popular buildings, which can encourage the surrounding competitiveness.
            The overall quality of the buildings will be increased among the competition.</p>
